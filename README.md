# ARTutorialsPlatform

## Project Description
ARTutorialsPlatform is a decentralized platform built on Ethereum that enables creators to monetize their Augmented Reality (AR) tutorials and content. It allows creators to upload their tutorials with a price tag, while users can purchase and access high-quality AR content directly through the blockchain.

2. **Direct Payments to Creators**  
   - Users pay directly to the tutorial creator in Ether (ETH).

3. **Secure Purchase System**  
   - Prevents duplicate purchases by tracking user ownership of tutorials.

4. **Tutorial Details on Blockchain**  
   - Information about each tutorial (title, description, URL, price, and purchase count) is stored immutably.

5. **Ownership Validation**  
   - Users can confirm their ownership of purchased tutorials via blockchain records.

6. **Event Notifications**  
   - Notifications for tutorial creation and purchases through blockchain events.
